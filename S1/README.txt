TASK 1:
For the first task we have installed the latest version of ffmpeg and checked that it has been correctly installed.

TASK2:
The second task consists on two methods, where the first one translate values in RGB into YUV and the other one performs the opposite operation, from YUV to RGB.

Task 3:
The third task consists on a method that resizes an image into lower quality. To do so we send a command to the terminal which calls directly ffmpeg to resize the image.

Task 4:
This method prints the values of a matrix in a serpentine way as we saw on theory. In order to achieve that we perform a double for with some conditional if's to iterate through each cell.

Task 5:
In this task we have implemented three methods. The first one transforms an image into black and white, the second compresses the image and the third one applies a run-length encoding to a serie of bytes.

Task 6:
For this task we have implemented a new class called DCTConverter which has two methods. One that encodes a given input and another that decodes a given input.

Task 7:
The final task implements another class called DWTConverter which has a method called converter that converts a given input applying a Discrete Wavelet Transform.


We also added some tests to check that all methods work properly.
